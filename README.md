## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned my way around CSS Grid. While it can be challenging to implement, I feel that I'm making progress. This experience has also helped me develop my visualization skills, which I gained during my UX/UI training.

Additionally, using SCSS has proven to be quite useful in speeding up the writing of CSS. The ability to use features like nesting, variables, and mixins has made my stylesheets more organized and maintainable.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on the following areas:

**Honing CSS Grid Skills**: I aim to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid by exploring more advanced layout techniques and use cases. I want to experiment with different grid configurations and learn how to effectively combine Grid with other layout methods, such as Flexbox, to create responsive and visually appealing designs.
